\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Proof Details for Theorem~\ref{thm:consistency}}

We expand the sketch by showing that exact consistency is necessary by reduction on Dirac measures and sufficient by dominated convergence for bounded test functions under pushforward/pullback operations.

\subsection{Bounded Variation and Subsequence Determinism}

We outline how bounded ambiguity and length‑monotone mappings admit subsequential realizations, referencing standard constructions in finite‑state morphology.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

- Trie storage format, transition table layout, and cache‑friendly packing.
- Byte fallback encoding for non‑ASCII characters.
- Export format alignment with \texttt{tokenizers} JSON schema.

\subsection{Hyperparameters and Datasets}

Provide corpus sizes, vocabulary budgets, $N$ and $\theta$ settings, and train/validation splits for each domain.
