\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced \textbf{Domain-Specific Tokenization (DST)}, a unified framework that treats tokenization as an invertible and auditable mapping rather than a heuristic preprocessing step.
By formalizing tokenization as paired mappings $(\tau,\kappa)$, DST provides theoretical reliability guarantees, deterministic finite-state realizability, and grammar-guided domain awareness within a single deployable system.

DST establishes a reproducible experimental framework for evaluating efficiency, reliability, and compatibility across structured domains such as code, configuration, and network data.
Future work will extend DST toward adaptive and multimodal tokenization, enabling continuous vocabulary evolution while maintaining exact reversibility and alignment with large-scale pretraining.
